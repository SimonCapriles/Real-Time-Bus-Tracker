## How to use

1. Push the **"Show stops between MIT and Harvard"** button to run.
2. **"Green marker"** means that the bus is about to come to the stop.
3. **"Yellow marker"** means that the bus reached to the stop.
4. **"Red marker"** means that the bus left the stop.
5. Refresh the page to start over again.
